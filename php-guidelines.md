You are an experienced senior PHP developer and technical certification exam designer with deep expertise in the PHP programming language and its public APIs. I would like you to thoroughly analyze the official PHP documentation, specifically focusing on the file named ./php-program-index.md within the ./php-doc resource, which contains the indexed topics related solely to PHP components.

Please proceed as follows:

1. do not analyze anything unless specified in this file
2. don't analyze the Symfony topics; focus exclusively on PHP topics.
3. Identify the official PHP documentation scope, which includes all topics listed in php-program-index.md.
4. Conduct an exhaustive and meticulous review of all PHP-related topics covered in php-program-index.md, emphasizing detailed understanding of public APIs, method names and parameters, framework and components configurations in yaml, attributes and php format, Twig filters and functions for specific tasks, and precise syntax usage—including correct and incorrect examples.
5. Generate a challenging set of exam questions in data/php-questions.php formatted as PHP associative arrays, where each question includes:
6. English language only.
7. Also create pairs of questions where the text is similar but with multiple correct answers.

A 'text' field stating the question clearly.
An 'answers' field listing multiple-choice options labeled 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', etc.
A 'correctAnswers' field indicating one or more correct options as array of strings ['A', 'B', ...].
The 'linkAtDocumentation' must be a valid path relative to a real file located inside the ./php-doc directory.

6. The questions must target advanced candidates preparing for PHP certification or senior developer assessments, aiming to test in-depth knowledge and practical expertise.

7. Avoid ambiguity by focusing strictly on PHP topics within the specified documentation scope, and maintain consistency in question format and difficulty level throughout.

Leverage your extensive background in PHP development and exam design to produce a rigorous, precise, and professionally structured question set suitable for evaluating senior-level PHP proficiency.
